The HITRAN-Refractive-Indices (HITRAN-RI) IDL program

This program reads in the HITRAN2020 indices of refraction and
calculates Mie spectra based upon the user's specification
of a specific refractive index set and a specific particle 
size distribution.

To unpack the    hitran_ri.tar   tar file that has the programs and
all subdirectories, use the command     tar -xf hitran_ri.tar

One will see the following subdirectories and files

*****
ascii             ascii files of the refractive indices
netcdf            netCDF files of the refractive indices

fortran_ascii     fortran 90 code (reads in the ascii files of the indices, does
                  a Mie calculation, and sends calculations to output ascii files)
idl_calc          IDL code (reads in netCDF files of the indices, does 
                  a Mie calculation, and sends calculations to output ascii, netCF
                  and ps graphics files) 
python_calc       Python code (reads in the ascii files of the indices, does 
                  a Mie calculation, and sends calculations to an output ascii file
                  The program also displays a graph of the extinction spectrum

papers            has pdfs of the original reference papers of the indices
commentary.pdf    recommended books on light scattering and particle size distributions
massie_hervig_JSQRT_2013.pdf   pdf of the JQSRT paper which discusses the HITRAN-RI program

You may want to use the unix command   chmod 644 *.pro to get rid
of the *'s after the download  or unpacking is done, and   chmod 755 netcdf   etc
for the archive, ascii, commentary, fortran, etc  subdirectories

********************
Using the   idl_calc   subdirectory as an example:

There are four .dat ascii files
  directory.dat      
  indices.dat  
  work.dat
  compare_spectra.dat

In the   directory.dat   ascii file:
Specify the subdirectory which has the netCDF input refractive indices files
Specify the subdirectory to which output text and ps files are written to
The subdirectories are one level down from the directory that contains
the .pro's and the .dat files.

The   indices.dat   ascii file lists the refractive index files (leave as is)
The listing is coordinated with the  rdindices.pro  routine which reads in
a specific set of indices

The  compare_spectra.dat  ascii file in the compare_spectra subdirectory
specifies which spectra files to intercompare (the user places ascii files of
calculations and/or observed extinction spectra in this subdirectory)

The   work.dat   ascii file specifies the work to be done.
EDIT this file to specify the specific work to be done.
Generally, integer flags are set to 1 to do something, 0 to not do something.
See the   example   subdirectory for an example of the work.dat file and the output
produced by the program

itest      Specify itest=1 in work.dat if a test case is to be calculated.

icompare   Specify icompare=1 if you compare (graph) two sets of indices.

imix       Compare mixing rules

imultisets To graph the indices from several sets of indices put imultisets=1
           This is done after the user runs the program for the desired sets of indices
           and places the output ascii files in the multisets subdirectory
           See the comments in multisetsgraph.pro for details

Normally, itest=0, icompare=0, imix=0,  imultisets=0

iset       For the main calculation, specify which index set is used
           The iset value corresponds to one of the sets listed in the
           indices.dat   ascii file. The indices.dat file and rdindices.pro
           routine will change as more indices are incorporated into the
           IDL program.
igraphi    If=1 will graph the indices of refraction (original set and
           those interpolated to the specified output scale).

iwave      If=1 will use an output wavenumber scale.
           If=2 will use an output wavelength scale.
w1,w2,dw   The range of wavenumber (or wavelength) and point spacing.

The size distribution is a log-normal size distribution with 2 modes 
den1,rad1,sig1    total number (#/cm3), mean radius (microns), distribution width 
den2,rad2,sig2    total number (#/cm3), mean radius (microns), distributiion width 
Note that alog(sig1) and alog(sig2) are used in the log-normal distributions, so
the input sig1 is e.g. 2.3 

igraphd    If=1 will graph the size distribution used in the calculation.

igraphe    To graph the extinction, scattering, absorption, asymmetry, and
           single scattering albedo spectra put igraphe=1

Other print flags allows one to write out the details from the various
parts of the code, and write out ascii and netCDF files of the output
from the code.

****
To run the idl program, type in    idl   on the command line
> idl
folowed by 
>.r main

The program will ask you some information (the specifics depend upon on which
refractive index set you work with). The program prints out to the screen (e.g. 
tells you the path names of various ps graphics, ascii and netCDF data files
that are created by the program)

A variety of ps files (for the indices, size distribution, and spectra of extinction, scattering,
absorption, single scattering albedo, and asymmetry parameter) and ascii files of these 
quantities are sent to the    output  subdirectory.
The ps (postscript graphics files) can be viewed on the user's laptop by the    gv   command
(type gv followed by the name of the ps file)

The   f.out   ascii file (in the idl_calc subdirectory from which you run the program) also contains the results
of the calculation.

An example (using the Deguine volcanic ash indices, published in 2020) is given in the example subdirectory
cp  the work.dat file to the subdirecotry   idl_calc

********************
The Python program

Edit the work.dat file

In this edition of the Pythoa programn, the work.dat file is shorter thna the idl_calc work.dat file
The Python program does the bare essentials (specify the material to work with, specify the 
particle size distribution, specify the wavelength range, and then calculate the extinction spectrum).

To run the Python program type
./ri_main.py

An extinction spectrum should appear on the screen (provided you have a graphics application
installed on your laprop, and you have access to the python matplotlib). 
The png of what's shown is in the    ext.png   file 

I had the freeware Xming application installed on my laptop.
See  https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/

To not do the graph, set   igraph=0   in   calc_ext.py
since calc_ext.py has these lines of code after igraph=1 is specificed
        import matplotlib
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

The f.out ascii output file (in the subdirectory from which you run the Python code) has the extinction, scattering,
absorption, single scattering albedo, and asymmetry parameter spectra.

An example (for the use of the 2020 Deguine volcanic ash indices) is given in the example subdirectory
cp the   work.dat   file to the    python_calc   subdirectory

********************
The fortran f.90 program

The user will need to edit the   Makefile   to specify the compiler that
is to be used

For the version I applied, I had these lines in the Makefile

SET2= -L/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.8.5/
SET3= -L/usr/pgi/linux86-64/14.9/lib/ -lgfortran
prg: $(SRCS)
        gfortran $(FFLAGS) -o prg $(SRCS)  -L/usr/local/lib  \
        $(SET2) $(SET3)

The command line       
> make

produced the   prg*   executable

Next, edit the   work.dat   file

To run the fortran program type
>./prg

The fortran program does not output graphics files or netCDF files

The calculated spectra are given in the   f.out   ascii file and the 
  ext.ascii  indices_interp.ascii  indices_orig.ascii  size.ascii
files also written to the directory from which the fortran_ascii program is run from. 

An example (for the use of the 2020 Deguine volcanic ash indices) is given in the example subdirectory
cp the    work.dat   file to the     fortran_ascii   subdirectory
