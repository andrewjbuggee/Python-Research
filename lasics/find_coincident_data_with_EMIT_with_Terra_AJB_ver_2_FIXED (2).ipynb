    "# How to: Find EMIT Data using NASA's CMR API and Download\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will explain how to access Earth Surface Minteral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) data programmaticly using NASA's CMR API. The Common Metadata Repository (CMR) is a metadata system that catalogs Earth Science data and associated metadata records. The CMR Application Programming Interface (API) provides programatic search capabilities through CMR's vast metadata holdings using various parameters and keywords. When querying NASA's CMR, there is a limit of 1 million granules matched and only 2000 granules returned per page. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "+ A NASA [Earthdata Login](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/) account is required to download EMIT data   \n",
    "+ Selected the `emit_tutorials` environment as the kernel for this notebook.\n",
    "  + For instructions on setting up the environment, follow the the `setup_instructions.md` included in the `/setup/` folder of the repository.  \n",

    "   - Make sure you have a `.netrc` file in your home directory with your NASA credentials\n",
    "   - Set permissions: `chmod 600 ~/.netrc`\n",
    "   - File format should be:\n",

    "     login your_username\n",
    "     password your_password\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check wget is installed**:\n",
    "   - `wget` should be available on macOS by default\n",
    "   - Test with: `wget --version`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Manual download alternative**:\n",
    "   - The URLs are saved to `urls_to_download.txt` \n",
    "   - You can manually download with: `wget -P /Users/anbu8374/Downloads/coincident_data/ -i /Users/anbu8374/Downloads/coincident_data/urls_to_download.txt`\n"
